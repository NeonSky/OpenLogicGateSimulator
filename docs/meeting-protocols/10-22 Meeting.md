1. News affecting the team

* We're done (except for peer review / eventual feedback) :tada:.
* We had some issues with sending the zip file because gradle.bat, but seems like things worked out in the end.

2. Are there any personal schedule changes affecting how we can work?

Everyone in the team will be focusing on the math exam this week, so there will be a very limited amount of work done on the project this week.

3. What are we doing? Are there any bottlenecks or do we need help with anything?

We are waiting for our supervisor to give us another group's project to review. Hopefully we can write that report during Thursday.

4. Assign/reassign issues and tasks to group members.

There is a JaCoco issue left in the project which aims to add 100% test coverage for the model.
If anyone has time to spare they are free to contribute to the current PR.

5. Prioritisation: are we doing the right things? Are we closing in on any deadlines?

Yes, we need to study for the other exam as well.
