1. News affecting the team

We're getting progress on the new features.

2. Are there any personal schedule changes affecting how we can work?

Martin is occupied on thursday evening as usual. Jacob needs to write a report this week, but it will propbably not be too time consuming. Jimmy will not be able to work on this project after 4 pm any day this week, since he has a deadline at work.

3. What are we doing? Are there any bottlenecks or do we need help with anything?

Panning is there but very buggy.
Jimmy started writing his own tab pane / view but then realized that there is a built in one.
Support for dynamic components is added.
Some bug finding.

4. Assign/reassign issues and tasks to group members.

Elias: Fix panning
Jacob: BFS approach for simulating circuit state
Jimmy: Multiple workspaces / Tabs
Martin: Saving and loading components

5. Prioritisation: are we doing the right things? Are we closing in on any deadlines?

Martin focused a bit much on bug finding rather than the new feature.
Jimmy wasted time rewriting something that already existed in JavaFX which was a shame.

6. Start doing..? / Continue doing..? / Stop doing..?

Start checking if JavaFX/libraries already supports what you want to accomplish.

7. Date and time for next meeting?
